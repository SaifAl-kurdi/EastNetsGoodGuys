Collections:
    1- Mutable?     2- Fixed Size?      3- Indexed?

1- Array:
    int[] x = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
                or
    int[] x = new int [size];
    The problem of the array is it a fixed size.

2- List:
    a- Array list
    b- LinedList
    c- Vector
    d- Stack

3- Queue
    a- PriorityQueue
    b- ArrayDequeue

4- Set:
    a- TreeSet
    b- HashSet
    c- LinkedHashsSt

5- Map:
    a- TreeMap.
    b- HashMap.
    c- LinkedHashMap



Here the normal array is a fixed size, but the other collections are dynamic size.
    The different between them here:
        1- The Set is dynamic indexed array.
        2- The queue is not indexed array.
        3- The set is not indexed array at the same time is non-duplicated elements.
        4- The map is dictionary (key, value).

How to Persist on the database like 50MB, how to make it (find the solution) (like you can change the )
FTP work in the ftp service, the FTP will work as (Middleware) between the front-end and the back-end,
that mean the back-end will chick always in the ftp service if they any file upload, if there are any file will upload in the ftp service,
the back-end will req for the ftp service to persist to the database,
but this microservice it's better work also as middleware (it's just make a parse the file then produce it in the topic in the kafka,
then also there is one addition microservice work and this microservice just make persist to the database).

And there are many of the ftp services already exists (Search about them and fine most suitable one).

(How to use ftp service between the front end back).

Designing an architecture to handle large XML files (e.g., 50MB) using FTP as a middleware between the front-end and back-end,
with Apache Kafka for asynchronous processing and microservices for parsing and database persistence, involves several key components.
Below is a proposed architecture and considerations for selecting suitable FTP services.

Proposed Architecture

1. FTP Service (Middleware):
   - Function: Acts as an intermediary where the front-end uploads XML files. The back-end monitors this service for new files
   - Process:
     - Front-end uploads XML files to the FTP server.
     - Back-end continuously monitors the FTP server for new uploads.

2. File Monitoring Service:
   - Function: Detects new files in the FTP server and initiates processing
   - Process:
     - Upon detecting a new file, it reads the file and publishes its content to a specific Kafka topic for further processing.

3. Kafka Broker:
   - Function: Serves as the message broker facilitating communication between microservices 
   - Process:
     - Receives messages (file contents) from the File Monitoring Service.
     - Distributes messages to subscribed microservices for processing.

4. Parsing Microservice:
   - Function: Consumes messages from Kafka, parses the XML content, and publishes structured data to another Kafka topic
   - Process:
     - Consumes XML data from the designated Kafka topic.
     - Parses the XML to extract relevant information.
     - Publishes the structured data to a different Kafka topic for persistence.

5. Persistence Microservice:
   - Function: Consumes structured data from Kafka and persists it to the database
   - process:
     - Consumes structured data from the Kafka topic.
     - Performs necessary transformations or validations.
     - Inserts the data into the chosen database system.

6. Database:
   - Function: Stores the parsed and structured data for querying and analysis
   - Considerations: Selection between SQL and NoSQL databases should be based on the data's nature and querying requirements

    For the system, NoSQL (MongoDB) is the better choice. Here's why:
        Why NoSQL (MongoDB or DynamoDB)?
            1. Unstructured & Semi-Structured Data
                - XML data is hierarchical and semi-structured, which aligns well with NoSQL document-based storage.
                - NoSQL databases like MongoDB store data as JSON/BSON, making it easier to store and retrieve parsed XML files.

            2. Scalability
                - NoSQL databases scale horizontally, meaning they can handle large file processing and concurrent reads/writes more efficiently.
                - MongoDB Atlas or DynamoDB provide cloud-native solutions that can scale automatically.

            3. Faster Reads/Writes for Large Documents
                - SQL databases struggle with very large objects (BLOBs).
                - MongoDB GridF Scan efficiently handle large XML files by breaking them into smaller chunks.
                        - In MongoDB, use GridFS for storing files larger than 16 MB. In some situations,
                            storing large files may be more efficient in a MongoDB database than on a system-level filesystem.
                            If your filesystem limits the number of files in a directory, you can use GridFS to store as many files as needed.
                        - GridFS organizes files in a bucket, a group of MongoDB collections that contain the chunks of files and information describing them.
                            The bucket contains the following collections: The chunks collection, which stores the binary file chunks.
                            The files collection, which stores the file metadata.

            4. Flexible Schema
                - XML files may have different structures, and NoSQL databases can store varying document structures easily.
                - SQL databases require rigid schemas, making updates and changes harder.

        When to Consider SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)?
            - If the XML data needs to be highly relational and requires complex JOIN operations.
            - If ACID transactions are critical (e.g., financial applications).
            - If structured schema enforcement is required.

        Final Decision: NoSQL (MongoDB)
            - Best choice for scalability, performance, and flexibility.
            - Handles large, hierarchical XML data well.
            - Easier to integrate with Kafka and microservices.

FTP Service Selection

When selecting an FTP service to integrate into this architecture, consider the following factors:
    - Scalability: Ability to handle large files and multiple simultaneous connection.
    - Security: Support for secure file transfer protocols (e.g., FTPS, SFTP) to ensure data protectio.
    - Integration Capabilities: Ease of integration with monitoring tools and compatibility with the existing technology stack.
    - Reliability: Robustness in handling file transfers without data loss or corrupt.

Potential FTP Services:
    1. FileZilla Server:
       - Overview: An open-source FTP and FTPS server known for its reliability and ease of us
       - Pros: Supports large file transfers, secure protocols, and is highly configurable
       - Cons: Limited to Windows platforms, may require additional setup for monitoring capabilities

    2. ProFTPD:
       - Overview: A versatile FTP server for Unix-based systems, supporting FTP, FTPS, and SFT
       - Pros: Highly configurable, supports large files, and integrates well with Unix system
       - Cons: Configuration complexity can be high; primarily designed for Unix environment

    3. vsftpd (Very Secure FTP Daemon):
       - Overview: A secure and fast FTP server for Unix-like system.
       - Pros: Emphasizes security and performance; supports virtual users and IPv
       - Cons: Limited feature set compared to other servers; configuration can be less intuitiv

    4. Serv-U FTP Server:
       - Overview: A commercial FTP server solution offering extensive features and suppor
       - Pros: User-friendly interface, robust security features, and excellent suppor
       - Cons: License costs; may be overkill for simple use case

That mean to deal with the FTP server:
    - You should use Java (Apache Commons Net) to Interact With FTP Server.
    - Log in with the username and password
    - Upload files


Recommendation:
For a microservices architecture that requires robust integration and monitoring capabilities, ProFTPD or vsftpd are suitable choices, especially in Unix-based environment.
They offer the necessary scalability and security features and can be integrated with monitoring tools to detect new file upload.
If a Windows-based solution is preferred, FileZilla Server provides a reliable and configurable option.


Integration Considerations
    - File Monitoring: Implement a monitoring mechanism (e.g., inotify on Linux) to detect new files in the FTP directory and trigger the File Monitoring Service.
    - Error Handling: Incorporate robust error handling and retry mechanisms in each microservice to ensure fault tolerance.
    - Security: Ensure secure communication between components, especially when handling sensitive dat
    - Scalability: Design microservices to be stateless where possible, allowing horizontal scaling to handle increased loa

The first thing I should create a FTPClient, then I can proceed to upload a file to the server.
